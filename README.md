# Mechanic-Business-Page
This application separates the UI, like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, from the server logic, like Node.js and Express. We also used a public folder to store the CSS, database, and image files. There are also 2 separate folders to store pages and partials. For routes, we used Express in order to create a server and use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
